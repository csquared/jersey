Because [worse is better](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better).

Jersey is a gem for people who want to write excellent APIs but have their
own opinions on how to structure their code and projects.

We provide sensible defaults that are composed with sensible pieces, making
it easy to compose your own stack.
